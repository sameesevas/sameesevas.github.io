## Enhancing Autonomous Vehicle Pipelines with a Reasoning Layer
<p>
In the perception layer of the autonomous vehicle pipeline, objects are first detected and tracked. Then, in the reasoning layer, we predict the intention of each object using a vision–language model.

## Solar Irradiation Prediction
<p>
The study focuses on improving solar irradiance prediction in Bangladesh using advanced machine learning techniques. It highlights the importance of ensemble learning, which combines multiple models for more accurate forecasts. Unlike previous research, this study explores ensemble AI methods and introduces Explainable AI (XAI) to provide insights into prediction factors. A novel hybrid approach using clustering techniques and the LightGBM algorithm is proposed for better efficiency. Additionally, an AutoML tool integrating XAI and ensemble learning is developed. The results, validated with PyCaret, show that LightGBM performs best for solar irradiance prediction.

## Earthquake Magnitude and Damage Prediction
<p>
Our study focuses on improving earthquake magnitude and damage prediction using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. It bridges a research gap by comparing ML and DL models for magnitude prediction, evaluating 12 algorithms, including ensemble-based methods, using various performance metrics. Additionally, it explores earthquake damage prediction by optimizing ensemble ML models with hyperparameter tuning, an area not previously studied. The research highlights the importance of hyperparameter optimization in enhancing predictive accuracy and resilience. The findings contribute to both seismic risk assessment and broader applications, such as climate change analysis.
