👨🏻‍💻 I'm a Software Engineer at *Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh*.


🎓 I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from *Military Institute of Science and Technology (MIST)*, graduating with a CGPA of 3.79/4.00.

🔐 My research focuses on software security and privacy, integrating human factors to develop systems that are both reliable and accessible.

🤖 I'm also curious about the evolving landscape of Generative AI, the challenges and risks tied to its adoption, and how it shapes the future of technology.

📚 I'm a prospective PhD student for Fall 2025.
